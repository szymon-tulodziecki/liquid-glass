// dies where the bevel meets the flat interior.
//
// [!] It is a constant and must STAY one. It overlaps with profile_shape_n,
// which is a real preferences slider, and shipping both would be two sliders
// fighting over one effect with no way for anyone to reason about which to
// reach for. Measured on the shipped configuration (bevel 30px, max_z 32.5,
// displacement_scale 47, ior 2.4) — displacement in px at depth u:
//
//     u =            0     2     5     8    12    18
//   falloff 2.4    66    47    23    12     5     1     <- this constant

// i.e. profile_shape_n reaches the same shape and further, because it is what
// actually decides how square the dome is, and a square dome IS "the
// refraction builds up abruptly at the rim". The three optical sliders divide
// the job cleanly between them and none of them needs a fourth:
//
//   displacement_scale — the glass's optical thickness. Multiplies the whole
//       field uniformly (47 -> 94 doubles every row above). Pure magnitude.
//   max_z              — the dome's height, i.e. how steep the normals get.
//       Magnitude too, but weighted towards wherever the profile is steep.

// the geometry is not what is aliasing — the texture lookup is.
