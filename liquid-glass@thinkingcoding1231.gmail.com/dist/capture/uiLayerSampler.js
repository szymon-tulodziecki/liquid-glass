/**
 * How UILayerSampler supplies a uiGroup child that has a Blur My Shell target
 * under it.
 *
 * Neither of the first two is right, and which one is in use decides which
 * symptom appears — measured in a native session by toggling the two
 * extensions on in either order:
 *
 *   SNAPSHOT — Liquid Glass sees BMS at clone time and takes a self-excluding
 *     stage snapshot of the child's rect. BMS itself keeps working, but the
 *     snapshot is of the WHOLE stage cropped to that rect, so anything else
 *     overlapping it is captured too: with the dock moved to the top edge it
 *     overlaps the panel and its icons show up as ghosts inside the dock's own
 *     glass. The window texture lag was reported in this configuration as well.
 *
 *   CLONE — Liquid Glass was enabled first, found no BMS target, and made an
 *     ordinary Clutter.Clone. No ghosts and no lag, but BMS's own panel
 *     rendering drifts by about 10px wherever the dock overlaps the panel:
 *     Shell.BlurEffect in background mode samples the framebuffer under the
 *     actor, and painting that actor a second time inside our offscreen gives
 *     it a second, differently-positioned consumer.
 *
 *   SKIP — leave the child out of the glass entirely. No ghosts, no lag, BMS
 *     untouched; the cost is that the panel simply does not appear in the
 *     blurred backdrop.
 *
 * Switchable at runtime (global._lgGlass.bmsMode(n)) so the attribution can be
 * settled inside one session instead of by rebuilding between orders.

// [FIX] SKIP is the default, confirmed by switching all three modes in one
// native session with BMS's dynamic panel blur on:
//
//   0 SNAPSHOT -> window texture lag + the dock's own icons ghosted into its
//                 glass (the snapshot is the whole stage cropped to the
//                 child's rect, and it runs a full stage paint with our root
//                 hidden on every after-paint — the very "toggle live UI
//                 visibility every frame" that memo.md's addendum 3 records
//                 as breaking Clutter's damage bookkeeping)
//   1 CLONE    -> lag and ghosts gone, but BMS's own panel drifts ~10px
//                 wherever the dock overlaps it
//   2 SKIP     -> all three gone; the panel simply is not in the glass
//
// SKIP breaks nothing, but it gives up the panel: with the dock at the top
// edge the dock's glass is drawn ABOVE panelBox, so a panel that is not in the
// glass is a panel that is not on screen there at all.
//
//   3 REPLICATE -> the default. None of the three costs above.
//
// REPLICATE works because of one structural detail of BMS: it inserts its
// blur widget into panel_box as a SIBLING of the panel
// (components/panel.js — `panel_box.insert_child_at_index(background_group, 0)`),
// not as a child of it. So "the panel without BMS's blur widget" is not
// something that has to be filtered out of a clone — it is simply a different
// actor to clone. BMS is then never painted a second time, which is the whole
// of the CLONE problem, and nothing is snapshotted, which is the whole of the
// SNAPSHOT problem.
//
// What that leaves missing is the blurred backdrop BMS draws behind the panel,
// so we draw our own in its place: the same effect class BMS uses
// (Shell.BlurEffect in BACKGROUND mode — see BMS's
// effects/native_dynamic_gaussian_blur.js) with the same live radius and
// brightness, sitting under the panel clone inside our own offscreen, where
// what is "behind" it is our own cloned wallpaper and windows. Same effect,
// same parameters, same input relationship — so it reproduces what BMS draws

     * [FIX] Re-checks the Blur My Shell decision when BMS comes or goes.
     *
     * Which clone a uiGroup child gets depends on whether a BMS target is found
     * underneath it, and that was decided once, when the clone was first built.
     * So the two extensions behaved differently depending on the order they were
     * switched on:
     *
     *   BMS first, then this one — the target is found, the child is supplied as
     *     a self-excluding snapshot, and BMS keeps working.
     *   This one first, then BMS — nothing was found, so the child is an
     *     ordinary Clutter.Clone. BMS then installs its effect on an actor that
     *     already has a second consumer, and its own panel rendering drifts
     *     (reported: about 10px, whenever the dock overlaps the panel).
     *
     * Driven by comparing the resolved target each refresh rather than by
     * extension-state-changed: BMS populates _panel_blur.actors_list during and
     * after its own enable(), so a signal handler can easily look too early,
     * while "the target is not what it was" is true whenever it settles.
