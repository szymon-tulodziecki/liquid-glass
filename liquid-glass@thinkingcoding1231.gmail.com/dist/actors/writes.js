// ─── [PERF] Idle gating: write a clone property only when it changes ─────────
//
// Every manager's BEFORE_REDRAW tick used to re-write translation_x/y,
// size, scale, pivot and opacity onto every clone of every glass, every
// frame, whether or not anything had moved. Clutter's setters for the
// transform properties do not compare before storing: they go straight to
// transform_changed() + clutter_actor_queue_redraw(). So a completely
// static desktop still damaged every clone 60 times a second, which damaged
// the glass that contains it, which re-ran capture + blur + composite for
// the whole nested stack.
//
// Measured (2026-09-11, 3 glass windows + dock, log__2.log):
//
//   state                     stage    glass paints   GPU
//   normal                    60 fps   ~600/s         ~47%
//   freezeSync(true)          ~35 fps  ~234/s         ~21%
//   extension off             --       0              ~3%
//
// GPU is linear in glass-paints-per-second, and the stage only ran at a
// full 60 fps because we kept damaging it. Nothing here changes what is
// drawn — only whether a redundant write is issued at all.
//
// The last written value is cached on the clone itself rather than read
// back from C: a GObject property read costs ~180ns through gjs (measured),
// and with hundreds of clone syncs per frame that alone is a millisecond.
// A JS expando is free, it is dropped with the actor, and nothing but these
// helpers ever writes these particular properties on our clones.
//
// A/B: global._lgGlass.diffWrites(false) restores the unconditional writes.

 * [PERF ①b] Culls a clone by OPACITY, not by visibility.
 *
 * clutter_actor_paint() opens with
 *
 *     if (!CLUTTER_ACTOR_IS_TOPLEVEL (self) &&
 *         ((priv->opacity_override >= 0) ? priv->opacity_override : priv->opacity) == 0)
 *       return;
 *
 * (clutter-actor.c:3526) — before the mapped check, before the paint node is
 * built. So a zero-opacity clone is skipped just as completely as a hidden
 * one, and its source is never painted through it: the nested glass does not
 * run either, which is the whole point of the cull.
 *
 * What it avoids is everything the `visible` route drags in. Toggling
 * visibility maps and unmaps the actor, which is landmine 8 in memo.md, and
 * setActorVisible()'s show path has to fire queue_relayout() on the clone AND
 * its parent to get an actor that was hidden mid-allocation unstuck. With a
 * cull that flips on every window drag that crosses a glass boundary, that is
 * a relayout storm — and a relayout is damage, which is exactly what this
 * whole line of work exists to stop producing.
 *
 * The clone's real opacity is restored by the caller's next
 * setOpacityIfChanged(): un-culling drops the cached value so the write
 * cannot be skipped.
