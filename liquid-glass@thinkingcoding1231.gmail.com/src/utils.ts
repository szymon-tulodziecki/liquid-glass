/**
 * Detects and repairs a glass subtree that Clutter has stopped allocating.
 *
 * ── The bug, from mutter's own source (clutter/clutter/clutter-actor.c,
 *    clutter/clutter/clutter-stage.c, GNOME 50) ────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. `clutter_actor_allocate()` opens with
 *
 *        if (!CLUTTER_ACTOR_IS_TOPLEVEL (self) &&
 *            !clutter_actor_is_mapped (self) &&
 *            !clutter_actor_has_mapped_clones (self))
 *          return;
 *
 *    — an early return that does NOT clear needs_width_request /
 *    needs_height_request / needs_allocation.
 *
 * 2. `clutter_stage_maybe_relayout()` STEALS the pending list before
 *    servicing it (`stolen_list = g_steal_pointer (&priv->pending_relayouts)`)
 *    and drops any entry it skips. So an actor that is queued and then
 *    unmapped before the stage gets to it is removed from the queue while
 *    keeping all three "needs" flags set.
 *
 * 3. From then on it is unreachable, because the PUBLIC entry point is
 *
 *        void clutter_actor_queue_relayout (ClutterActor *self)
 *        { _clutter_actor_queue_only_relayout (self); ... }
 *
 *    and `_clutter_actor_queue_only_relayout()` begins with
 *
 *        if (needs_width_request && needs_height_request && needs_allocation)
 *          return; /* save some cpu cycles *\/
 *
 *    It returns before emitting the signal, so nothing re-registers the
 *    actor with the stage. This is why every earlier attempt to fix this
 *    from JS by calling queue_relayout() — on the root, on each node of the
 *    chain, on the whole subtree — did exactly nothing.
 *
 * 4. A stranded ancestor also swallows every request from below, because
 *    children propagate through that same guarded function. The whole
 *    subtree stops being allocated: existing actors keep their last
 *    allocation, and actors created afterwards never get a first one at all
 *    (alloc = -Infinity, so nothing to paint with — the missing Overview /
 *    app-grid clone).
 *
 * ── The repair ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Clutter has exactly one escape hatch, and it uses it itself. In
 * `clutter_actor_real_map()`:
 *
 *        /* Avoid the early return in clutter_actor_queue_relayout() *\/
 *        priv->needs_width_request = FALSE;
 *        priv->needs_height_request = FALSE;
 *        priv->needs_allocation = FALSE;
 *        clutter_actor_queue_relayout (self);
 *
 * Those fields are private, so JS cannot clear them — but it can make
 * `real_map()` run, and `real_map()` runs for every actor of a subtree
 * being mapped. hide() followed by show() therefore unmaps and remaps the
 * whole glass subtree and clears the trap on every node in it.
 *
 * That is also, at last, the real explanation for the workaround found by
 * hand at the very start of this investigation: hiding the dock and showing
 * it again fixed the stuck clones. Not because the clones were rebuilt —
 * because the remap ran Clutter's own rescue.
 *
 * Both calls happen inside one frame tick, before any paint, so there is no
 * flicker. Gated on several consecutive stranded frames so a normal pending
 * relayout — `has_allocation()` is legitimately false whenever a relayout is
 * merely outstanding — can never trigger it.
 *
 * Returns true when a rescue was performed.

 *   make (and MetaWindowActor is NOT flagged NO_LAYOUT: it has no allocate
 *   vfunc at all, so its children go through
 *   `_clutter_actor_queue_only_relayout(parent)` and die there, instead of

/**
 * [FIX round 13] Works out where the actor's own pixels live inside the
 * padded capture texture, and where the composite quad has to be drawn so
 * that it lands exactly back on the actor.
 *
 * Two things were wrong before, and both came from the same guess — that
 * the capture's padding is split evenly around the actor.
 *
 * 1. The padding is NOT centred. ClutterOffscreenEffect.pre_paint() sizes
 *    its FBO from _clutter_actor_box_enlarge_for_effects(), which does:
 *
 *        w  = nearbyint(raw.x2 - raw.x1)
 *        x2 = ceilf(raw.x2 + 0.75)
 *        x1 = x2 - w - 3
 *
 *    For an integer-sized actor at a whole-pixel origin that yields
 *    x1 = -2, x2 = w + 1 — i.e. 2px of padding on the left/top and 1px on
 *    the right/bottom, for the 3px total this extension has always
 *    measured (964x563 capture for a 961x560 actor). Sampling from
 *    padding/2 = 1.5px therefore read half a pixel too far left/up.
 *
 * 2. Far more visibly: vfunc_paint_target() does NOT run in the actor's
 *    own coordinate space. clutter_offscreen_effect_paint_texture() wraps
 *    the paint_target call in a ClutterTransformNode carrying
 *    translate(fbo_offset_x, fbo_offset_y) — the very offset above — and
 *    then Clutter's own default paint_target draws the FULL texture at
 *    (0, 0, texWidth, texHeight). So in this space one unit is one capture
 *    TEXEL and the origin is the texture's top-left corner, which sits at
 *    actor-local (-2, -2). Drawing the composite at (0, 0, w, h), as this
 *    did, therefore shifted the entire glass up and to the left by that
 *    offset — the reported "-3px, -3px offset" on the dock, menus,
 *    notifications, application windows and the OSD.
 *
 * Returns UVs into the capture plus the destination rect in that texel
 * space. Everything is derived from the actor's paint volume, exactly as
 * Clutter derives it; the result is sanity-checked against the texture's
 * real size and falls back to the old centred assumption if the
 * replication ever stops matching (a Clutter change, a rotated actor, a
 * paint volume we can't read).

/**
 * Captures a small rectangle of the screen (the panel area) into a
 * `Clutter.Content`, for use as the "blurred panel" backdrop inside the
 * glass, while structurally guaranteeing the glass never captures itself.
 *
 * Background: Blur My Shell (BMS) blurs the real top panel using a native
 * (non-JS) Clutter effect. That effect has no public API to read its result,
 * and — critically — it assumes it is the *only* consumer of its target
 * actor's paint output. Cloning the BMS target directly (`Clutter.Clone`)
 * makes BMS think a second consumer has taken over, and the *real* panel
 * loses its blur. So we never clone or paint the BMS actor at all; instead
 * we take an independent snapshot of "what the screen looks like there".
 *
 * Why `paint_to_content()` specifically: it performs a one-off, synchronous
 * render of a stage rectangle into an offscreen buffer, completely separate
 * from the actual on-screen frame. That gives us two things a live
 * `Clutter.Clone` cannot:
 *   1. Self-exclusion: our own glass root (`bgActor`) sits directly above
 *      the panel in z-order and can visually overlap it (e.g. when a
 *      panel-anchored popup is open). If we captured "the whole composited
 *      screen" while our own glass was visible, we would capture our own
 *      glass along with the panel — and since we redraw using that captured
 *      image every frame, this becomes a runaway feedback loop: each new
 *      capture already contains yesterday's capture, nested one level
 *      deeper, forever. (Diagnostic tip that confirmed this: the nesting
 *      alternated right-side-up / upside-down with each additional level,
 *      matching a V-flip correction from an older capture method being
 *      compounded once per loop iteration.)
 *      We avoid this entirely by hiding our own root actor for the single
 *      synchronous `paint_to_content()` call, then restoring it immediately
 *      — so the glass structurally cannot appear in its own snapshot.
 *   2. No visible flicker: hide → capture → show all happens synchronously,
 *      before control returns to Clutter's normal repaint cycle, so the
 *      actual displayed frame is never affected.
 *
 * We also always pass `Clutter.PaintFlag.NO_CURSORS`. GNOME Shell's own
 * screenshot code (shell-screenshot.c) does the same for this exact API —
 * without it, the mouse pointer sprite gets composited into the snapshot,
 * which shows up as cursor smearing inside the glass.

/**
 * [FIX-5] "Quick Settings turns into a full-screen dark rectangle, Toggles
 * show nothing" the moment bgActor became a child of animActor (a real
 * St.BoxLayout, used for the actual quick-settings grid).
 *
 * Root cause: unlike a plain Clutter.Actor (which — absent an explicit
 * LayoutManager — does NOT roll its children's sizes into its own reported
 * preferred size; this is exactly why bgActor's own many manually-sized
 * descendants, or bgActor itself sitting under uiGroup, never caused any
 * such ballooning before), St.BoxLayout DOES actively query each direct
 * child's own get_preferred_width()/height() and stacks/sums them to
 * compute ITS OWN size. bgActor has an EXPLICIT fixed size set on it
 * directly (set_size(screenW, screenH) — see _syncToggleRegions()/
 * resolution-update code), and an actor's own explicitly-set size is
 * exactly what get_preferred_width()/height() reports back to a querying
 * parent, regardless of any layout manager. So animActor's BoxLayout was
 * faithfully doing its job: stacking a "child" that claims to want
 * 1920x1080, on top of the real ~1920x198 toggle content — hence the
 * ballooned (1958x1316) allocation and the screen-covering dark panel.
 *
 * Fix: LayoutOpaqueActor unconditionally reports (0,0) for both min and
 * natural size in both dimensions, no matter what its own children (e.g.
 * bgActor) request. A querying parent's LayoutManager takes exactly what
 * get_preferred_width()/height() returns as authoritative — it never looks
 * past that return value into the subtree — so this is a hard, guaranteed
 * "don't count anything below me towards your own size" boundary, usable
 * to wrap any actor (like bgActor) that must be dropped into a real
 * layout-managed container (like animActor) purely for z-order, with its
 * own geometry fully hand-managed instead of participating in that
 * container's size negotiation. Its own on-screen ORIGIN (x,y) still comes
 * from wherever the parent's layout manager decides to place a 0-sized
 * child — callers reposition it explicitly every frame regardless (see
 * quickSettingsManager.ts's animActor counter-transform), so that's fine.
