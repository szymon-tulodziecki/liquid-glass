/**
 * Detects and repairs a glass subtree that Clutter has stopped allocating.
 *
 * ── The bug, from mutter's own source (clutter/clutter/clutter-actor.c,
 *    clutter/clutter/clutter-stage.c, GNOME 50) ────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. `clutter_actor_allocate()` opens with
 *
 *        if (!CLUTTER_ACTOR_IS_TOPLEVEL (self) &&
 *            !clutter_actor_is_mapped (self) &&
 *            !clutter_actor_has_mapped_clones (self))
 *          return;
 *
 *    — an early return that does NOT clear needs_width_request /
 *    needs_height_request / needs_allocation.
 *
 * 2. `clutter_stage_maybe_relayout()` STEALS the pending list before
 *    servicing it (`stolen_list = g_steal_pointer (&priv->pending_relayouts)`)
 *    and drops any entry it skips. So an actor that is queued and then
 *    unmapped before the stage gets to it is removed from the queue while
 *    keeping all three "needs" flags set.
 *
 * 3. From then on it is unreachable, because the PUBLIC entry point is
 *
 *        void clutter_actor_queue_relayout (ClutterActor *self)
 *        { _clutter_actor_queue_only_relayout (self); ... }
 *
 *    and `_clutter_actor_queue_only_relayout()` begins with
 *
 *        if (needs_width_request && needs_height_request && needs_allocation)
 *          return; /* save some cpu cycles *\/
 *
 *    It returns before emitting the signal, so nothing re-registers the
 *    actor with the stage. This is why every earlier attempt to fix this
 *    from JS by calling queue_relayout() — on the root, on each node of the
 *    chain, on the whole subtree — did exactly nothing.
 *
 * 4. A stranded ancestor also swallows every request from below, because
 *    children propagate through that same guarded function. The whole
 *    subtree stops being allocated: existing actors keep their last
 *    allocation, and actors created afterwards never get a first one at all
 *    (alloc = -Infinity, so nothing to paint with — the missing Overview /
 *    app-grid clone).
 *
 * ── The repair ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Clutter has exactly one escape hatch, and it uses it itself. In
 * `clutter_actor_real_map()`:
 *
 *        /* Avoid the early return in clutter_actor_queue_relayout() *\/
 *        priv->needs_width_request = FALSE;
 *        priv->needs_height_request = FALSE;
 *        priv->needs_allocation = FALSE;
 *        clutter_actor_queue_relayout (self);
 *
 * Those fields are private, so JS cannot clear them — but it can make
 * `real_map()` run, and `real_map()` runs for every actor of a subtree
 * being mapped. hide() followed by show() therefore unmaps and remaps the
 * whole glass subtree and clears the trap on every node in it.
 *
 * That is also, at last, the real explanation for the workaround found by
 * hand at the very start of this investigation: hiding the dock and showing
 * it again fixed the stuck clones. Not because the clones were rebuilt —
 * because the remap ran Clutter's own rescue.
 *
 * Both calls happen inside one frame tick, before any paint, so there is no
 * flicker. Gated on several consecutive stranded frames so a normal pending
 * relayout — `has_allocation()` is legitimately false whenever a relayout is
 * merely outstanding — can never trigger it.
 *
 * Returns true when a rescue was performed.

 * @param framesBeforeRescue how many consecutive stranded frames to require

 *   see ApplicationManager._frameTick(), which has to rescue the
 *   MetaWindowActor itself because point 4 of the comment above means a
 *   stranded window actor swallows every relayout request its glass children
 *   make (and MetaWindowActor is NOT flagged NO_LAYOUT: it has no allocate
 *   vfunc at all, so its children go through
 *   `_clutter_actor_queue_only_relayout(parent)` and die there, instead of
 *   through `clutter_actor_queue_shallow_relayout(child)` straight onto the
 *   stage) — should ask for a longer streak, so a live window is never
 *   remapped for a relayout that was merely slow.
 */
/**
 * [anim-jitter] Rescue for a stranded MetaWindowActor, gentlest option first.
 *
 * ensureGlassAllocated()'s rescue is hide() + show(). On OUR actors that is
 * fine. On mutter's own window actor it is not something to do lightly, and
 * the 100ms-interval capture of a stuttering minimise shows how often it was
 * happening: 171 remaps across 70 seconds, over five different windows, ~3 a
 * second, every one of them landing in the middle of a window animation.
 *
 * Why it was reached for at all: a glass root's queue_relayout() dies inside
 *
 *     _clutter_actor_queue_only_relayout (windowActor)
 *       if (needs_width_request && needs_height_request && needs_allocation)
 *         return;  // save some cpu cycles
 *
 * whenever the window actor itself is stranded, so the request never reaches
 * the stage and the subtree stays unallocated.
 *
 * But that short-circuit is tested against THAT actor's own flags, and
 * neither MetaWindowGroup nor MetaWindowActor implements an allocate vfunc or
 * sets CLUTTER_ACTOR_NO_LAYOUT — their children go through Clutter's default
 * allocate, which recurses. So asking the PARENT to relayout is not swallowed:
 * the window group is normally allocated, the request reaches the stage, and
 * the next relayout allocates the window actor (needs_allocation is set) and
 * with it the whole glass subtree.
 *
 * Two stages, so the proven repair is still there as a backstop:
 *   relayoutFrames  ask the parent to relayout — costs one relayout
 *   remapFrames     hide()/show() the window actor, as before
 *
 * Returns which stage ran, '' for none, so the caller can log them apart and
 * the next capture says outright whether stage 1 is doing the work.

// ─── [PERF ①/①b] Capture clipping and clone culling ──────────────────────────
//
// Every glass is a ClutterOffscreenEffect, so each paint is
//
//   1. bind the offscreen FBO and clear it
//   2. paint the whole clone subtree into it
//        (wallpaper clone + every window clone + UI clones + BMS replica)
//   3. run the blur and the composite (vfunc_paint_target)
//
// The blur sub-rect (phase 8) and the composite sub-rect (②) only ever
// shrank step 3. Step 2 is still paid in full, and for the dock / menus /
// notifications / OSD / quick settings it is paid over the WHOLE MONITOR,
// because their bgActor is monitor-sized on purpose (see landmine 9 in
// memo.md: shrinking it breaks Blur My Shell's stage-coordinate blit).
//
// Application windows already avoid this: applicationManager builds a
// `clipBox` with clip_to_allocation and sizes it to the glass box, so their
// clone subtree is clipped to the glass already. These two switches bring
// the same saving to the other five.
//
// ①  captureClip — set_clip() on the clone container.
//    Verified against mutter 50.1 rather than assumed:
//      * clutter-actor.c:3570  a clip becomes a ClutterClipNode wrapping the
//        actor's node, INSIDE the actor's own transform node. So the clip
//        rect is in the same local space the children are positioned in, and
//        it is pushed while the offscreen framebuffer is current — which is
//        exactly why the existing bgActor.set_clip() never helped: bgActor
//        sits OUTSIDE the effect, so its clip only ever scissored the
//        composite into the stage framebuffer.
//      * clutter-offscreen-effect.c:346 sizes the FBO from
//        clutter_actor_get_paint_volume() of the effect's actor, and
//        clutter-actor.c:5586 builds that volume starting FROM THE ACTOR'S
//        OWN ALLOCATION and only ever unions children into it. liquidBox is
//        set_size(monitor) already, so clipping a descendant cannot shrink
//        it. The FBO keeps its size AND its origin => computeCaptureLayout(),
//        _lgCaptureOffset and BMS's stage-coordinate blit are all untouched.
//        This is what keeps landmine 9 out of the picture.
//
// ①b cloneCull — hide clones that fall outside that same rect.
//    set_clip() only scissors: the clipped-out actors still build and run
//    their paint nodes, and a NESTED glass renders into its own FBO, which
//    the parent's scissor does not touch at all. A clone with visible=false,
//    on the other hand, makes clutter_actor_paint() return immediately, so
//    its source is never painted THROUGH IT and the nested glass never runs.
//
//    That is the part that matters: it turns the 2^N nesting into
//    2^(number of windows actually overlapping this glass) without removing
//    the nesting itself. Nothing changes visually — a window that does not
//    intersect the glass box contributed zero pixels to the capture anyway.
//
//    UILayerSampler.syncProperties() has always done this test, but against
//    the CONTAINER's bounds, which are the whole monitor — so it never culled
//    anything. setCullRect() gives it a rect that means something.
//
// A/B: global._lgGlass.captureClip(false) / .cloneCull(false).
//

//   ① off, ①b on                               26-30%
//   both on                                    29%
//
// ① costs about 4 points and returns nothing, so it ships OFF. The reason is
// visible in the numbers rather than guessed at: the wallpaper and the window
// clones are a handful of large quads, and scissoring them saves far less
// fill than the extra clip push/pop and the batching it breaks costs — while
// the FBO is cleared at full size either way (clutter-paint-nodes.c:1034
// clears the whole layer node unconditionally).
//
// ①b is the one that pays, and for a different reason: it removes whole
// nested glass renders, which no amount of scissoring can.
//
// The ① code is kept, and kept working, because it is the only lever left if

//     advanced in uneven steps — the "カクカク" — even though the easing curve
//     itself is smooth.
//
// One driver fixes both. Every actor is stepped from the SAME timestamp, in
// the SAME pass, and the pass is a Meta.LaterType.BEFORE_REDRAW later, so it
// runs exactly once per frame, immediately before the frame that will show its
// result. Actors queued in one turn also share a start time (see `batchStart`)
// so a batch that flips together stays together for the whole tween.

//   Resources  (glass, 3s updates)  8/14   (latches, never recovers)
//   Resources  (glass, 0.25s)      11/14
//
// The clean fix is not to nest at all (clone the surface, not the window
// actor), but that costs the inner window its glass inside the backdrop. These
// two keep the nesting and repair it instead:
//
//   'recapture' (B) — mark the outer actor dirty EVERY frame. Always correct
//       because the capture is never reused, and it gives back the saving
//       phase 3's A2 bought by removing exactly this unconditional repaint.
//   'propagate' (C) — mark the outer actor dirty only on the frame after an
//       inner glass it clones re-rendered. Cheap, but it is one frame late by
//       construction, so the black turns from permanent into a flicker rather
//       than disappearing.

/**
 * [FIX round 13] Works out where the actor's own pixels live inside the

 * that it lands exactly back on the actor.
 *
 * Two things were wrong before, and both came from the same guess — that
 * the capture's padding is split evenly around the actor.
 *
 * 1. The padding is NOT centred. ClutterOffscreenEffect.pre_paint() sizes
 *    its FBO from _clutter_actor_box_enlarge_for_effects(), which does:
 *
 *        w  = nearbyint(raw.x2 - raw.x1)
 *        x2 = ceilf(raw.x2 + 0.75)
 *        x1 = x2 - w - 3
 *
 *    For an integer-sized actor at a whole-pixel origin that yields
 *    x1 = -2, x2 = w + 1 — i.e. 2px of padding on the left/top and 1px on
 *    the right/bottom, for the 3px total this extension has always
 *    measured (964x563 capture for a 961x560 actor). Sampling from
 *    padding/2 = 1.5px therefore read half a pixel too far left/up.
 *
 * 2. Far more visibly: vfunc_paint_target() does NOT run in the actor's
 *    own coordinate space. clutter_offscreen_effect_paint_texture() wraps
 *    the paint_target call in a ClutterTransformNode carrying
 *    translate(fbo_offset_x, fbo_offset_y) — the very offset above — and
 *    then Clutter's own default paint_target draws the FULL texture at
 *    (0, 0, texWidth, texHeight). So in this space one unit is one capture
 *    TEXEL and the origin is the texture's top-left corner, which sits at
 *    actor-local (-2, -2). Drawing the composite at (0, 0, w, h), as this
 *    did, therefore shifted the entire glass up and to the left by that
 *    offset — the reported "-3px, -3px offset" on the dock, menus,
 *    notifications, application windows and the OSD.
 *
 * Returns UVs into the capture plus the destination rect in that texel
 * space. Everything is derived from the actor's paint volume, exactly as
 * Clutter derives it; the result is sanity-checked against the texture's
 * real size and falls back to the old centred assumption if the
 * replication ever stops matching (a Clutter change, a rotated actor, a
 * paint volume we can't read).

/**
 * Captures a small rectangle of the screen (the panel area) into a
 * `Clutter.Content`, for use as the "blurred panel" backdrop inside the
 * glass, while structurally guaranteeing the glass never captures itself.
 *
 * Background: Blur My Shell (BMS) blurs the real top panel using a native
 * (non-JS) Clutter effect. That effect has no public API to read its result,
 * and — critically — it assumes it is the *only* consumer of its target
 * actor's paint output. Cloning the BMS target directly (`Clutter.Clone`)
 * makes BMS think a second consumer has taken over, and the *real* panel
 * loses its blur. So we never clone or paint the BMS actor at all; instead
 * we take an independent snapshot of "what the screen looks like there".
 *
 * Why `paint_to_content()` specifically: it performs a one-off, synchronous
 * render of a stage rectangle into an offscreen buffer, completely separate
 * from the actual on-screen frame. That gives us two things a live
 * `Clutter.Clone` cannot:
 *   1. Self-exclusion: our own glass root (`bgActor`) sits directly above
 *      the panel in z-order and can visually overlap it (e.g. when a
 *      panel-anchored popup is open). If we captured "the whole composited
 *      screen" while our own glass was visible, we would capture our own
 *      glass along with the panel — and since we redraw using that captured
 *      image every frame, this becomes a runaway feedback loop: each new
 *      capture already contains yesterday's capture, nested one level
 *      deeper, forever. (Diagnostic tip that confirmed this: the nesting
 *      alternated right-side-up / upside-down with each additional level,
 *      matching a V-flip correction from an older capture method being
 *      compounded once per loop iteration.)
 *      We avoid this entirely by hiding our own root actor for the single
 *      synchronous `paint_to_content()` call, then restoring it immediately
 *      — so the glass structurally cannot appear in its own snapshot.
 *   2. No visible flicker: hide → capture → show all happens synchronously,
 *      before control returns to Clutter's normal repaint cycle, so the
 *      actual displayed frame is never affected.
 *
 * We also always pass `Clutter.PaintFlag.NO_CURSORS`. GNOME Shell's own
 * screenshot code (shell-screenshot.c) does the same for this exact API —
 * without it, the mouse pointer sprite gets composited into the snapshot,
 * which shows up as cursor smearing inside the glass.

/**
 * [black-frame] Stand-in for

 * that renders the wallpaper WITHOUT going through Clutter.Clone.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — the "black frame" bug
 * ---------------------------------------
 * `MetaBackgroundContent` (the ClutterContent that actually paints the
 * wallpaper) culls itself against two regions that mutter stores ON THE
 * CONTENT OBJECT itself — mutter 50.1,
 * src/compositor/meta-background-content.c:
 *
 *   clip_region       the CURRENT FRAME'S DAMAGE REGION. Pushed down by
 *                     meta_window_group_paint() ->
 *                     meta_cullable_cull_redraw_clip() immediately before
 *                     the window group paints its children, and reset to
 *                     NULL immediately after.
 *   unobscured_region what is left of the wallpaper after the opaque
 *                     windows above it subtract themselves.
 *
 * meta_background_content_paint_content() applies BOTH unconditionally —
 * including while it runs inside a Clutter.Clone's paint. It even has an
 * explicit `clutter_actor_is_in_clone_paint()` branch, and that branch
 * still intersects with clip_region:
 *
 *     if (self->clip_region && mtk_region_is_empty (self->clip_region))
 *       return;                                      // paints NOTHING
 *     ...
 *     if (clutter_actor_is_in_clone_paint (actor))
 *       untransformed = FALSE;
 *     ...
 *     if (self->clip_region) {
 *       region = mtk_region_copy (self->clip_region);
 *       mtk_region_intersect_rectangle (region, &rect_within_actor);
 *     }
 *     ...
 *     if (self->unobscured_region)
 *       mtk_region_intersect (region, self->unobscured_region);
 *
 * A Clone paints its SOURCE actor, so it uses the SOURCE's content object —
 * which means a clone of _backgroundGroup inherits the real wallpaper's
 * per-frame culling state wholesale. In one sentence:
 *
 *   The wallpaper inside our glass only painted where THIS FRAME happened
 *   to be damaged.
 *
 * That is the whole bug. When a window behind the glass repaints on its own
 * (a system monitor, a terminal, a video), the frame's damage region is just
 * that window's rectangle. Any glass that re-captures its
 * ClutterOffscreenEffect FBO on that frame therefore captures the wallpaper
 * ONLY inside that rectangle and black everywhere else. Because
 * ClutterOffscreenEffect caches the FBO, the black then LATCHES until
 * something forces a full re-capture.
 *
 * Which is exactly the reported symptom, down to the details:
 *   - a bright rectangle around the updating background window, the rest of
 *     the glass filled flat (the tint over black);
 *   - a ~padding-wide gradient ring, darkening outwards, where the blur
 *     smears that black inwards from the FBO edge;
 *   - dump() / queue_redraw() / opening a menu clears it, because they force
 *     a full-screen damage and therefore a full, correct re-capture;
 *   - no reproduction steps, because it depends on which rectangle of the
 *     screen happened to be damaged on the frame the FBO was captured.
 *
 * THE FIX — and why it MUST still be painted through a Clone
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * Own the content, then clone OUR content. Both halves are required.
 *
 * Half 1: build our OWN Meta.BackgroundActor for each of the shell's,
 * sharing the same Meta.Background (no second wallpaper decode, no extra
 * texture) but carrying its own MetaBackgroundContent. Our actors hang off
 * a plain Clutter.Actor outside the window group, and
 * cull_out_children_common() in meta-cullable.c stops at any child that is
 * not a MetaCullable:
 *
 *     if (!META_IS_CULLABLE (child))
 *       continue;
 *
 * so our content's clip_region and unobscured_region stay NULL forever.
 *
 * Half 2 — THE PART THE FIRST ATTEMPT MISSED. Killing clip_region is not
 * enough, because paint_content has a SECOND clip and it reads the damage
 * region straight off the paint context:
 *
 *     if (untransformed) {
 *         if (self->clip_region) { ... }
 *         else {
 *             redraw_clip = clutter_paint_context_get_redraw_clip (paint_context);
 *             if (redraw_clip) { region = copy (redraw_clip); ... }   // <-- still partial!
 *         }
 *     } else {
 *         if (self->clip_region) { ... }
 *         else
 *             region = mtk_region_create_rectangle (&rect_within_actor);  // <-- FULL
 *     }
 *
 * and clutter_paint_context_push_framebuffer() does NOT reset redraw_clip,
 * so inside a glass's offscreen FBO it is still the frame's stage damage.
 *
 * `untransformed` is true exactly when the actor's stage rect equals its own
 * content box — which is precisely the case for a wallpaper actor parked at
 * (0,0) at monitor size, i.e. ours. So painting our mirror DIRECTLY lands in
 * the redraw_clip branch and is clipped to the damage region anyway. That is
 * what the first attempt did, and it was strictly WORSE than the clone it
 * replaced: dock / menu / OSD glasses paint from uiGroup, OUTSIDE the window
 * group, where clip_region has already been reset to NULL — so their clones
 * used to paint in full. Measured on two screencasts of the same bug:
 * 8% of frames flat-filled before, 34% after.
 *
 * The `else` branch is unconditional and full, and the way into it is
 * `clutter_actor_is_in_clone_paint()`, which is ancestor-aware:
 *
 *     if (self->priv->in_clone_paint) return TRUE;
 *     ... walks priv->parent while in_cloned_branch != 0 ...
 *
 * So: keep ONE shared source actor holding our uncalled background contents,
 * and give every glass a Clutter.Clone of it. In the clone paint
 * untransformed is FALSE and clip_region is NULL, which is the one
 * combination that paints the whole wallpaper unconditionally.
 *
 * It also restores the shell's wallpaper cross-fade inside the glass for
 * free: the glass clones a GROUP holding both the outgoing and incoming
 * background actors at their live opacities, exactly as cloning
 * _backgroundGroup used to.

/**
 * [window-clone-clip] Makes mutter stop clipping a window we CLONE to the
 * current frame's damage region.
 *
 * Same trap as BackgroundMirror, one actor further along. MetaSurfaceActor
 * implements MetaCullable, and its cull methods stash the frame's damage on
 * the texture that actually paints the window
 * (mutter 50.1, src/compositor/meta-surface-actor.c):
 *
 *     meta_surface_actor_cull_redraw_clip (cullable, clip_region)
 *       -> set_clip_region()  -> meta_shaped_texture_set_clip_region (stex, ...)
 *     meta_surface_actor_cull_unobscured (cullable, unobscured_region)
 *       -> set_unobscured_region()
 *
 * and meta_shaped_texture_paint_content() applies it with NO clone escape
 * hatch at all — unlike MetaBackgroundContent, it never even looks at
 * clutter_actor_is_in_clone_paint():
 *
 *     if (stex->clip_region && mtk_region_is_empty (stex->clip_region))
 *       return;                                    // paints NOTHING
 *     ...
 *     blended_tex_region = mtk_region_ref (stex->clip_region);
 *
 * So a Clutter.Clone of a MetaWindowActor paints that window only where the
 * frame happened to be damaged. Inside a glass that reads as: the wallpaper
 * is there (BackgroundMirror fixed that), but the windows behind the glass
 * are missing or smeared — the glass shows plain wallpaper where a behind-
 * window should be, a repaint leaves the previous frame's colours behind,
 * and opening a menu or clicking the panel makes the behind-window clones
 * vanish entirely for a frame while the wallpaper stays put.
 *
 * mutter has an opt-out for exactly this, in meta-cullable.c, and says so:
 *
 *     // If an actor has effects applied, then that can change the area
 *     // it paints and the opacity ... so we skip the actor.
 *     //
 *     // This has a secondary beneficial effect: if a ClutterOffscreenEffect
 *     // is applied to an actor, then our clipped redraws interfere with the
 *     // caching of the FBO ...  So, skipping actors with effects applied
 *     // also prevents these bugs.
 *     if (needs_culling && has_active_effects (child))
 *       needs_culling = FALSE;
 *     ...
 *     else
 *       method (META_CULLABLE (child), NULL);      // clip/unobscured := NULL
 *
 * has_active_effects() is just "does this actor carry an enabled
 * ClutterEffect", so parking a do-nothing effect on a window actor we clone
 * makes mutter hand its surface actor a NULL clip region and the clone paints
 * in full.
 *
 * Cost: that branch `continue`s without subtracting the actor's opaque region,
 * so a window carrying the opt-out no longer occludes what is behind it.
 * Only windows currently cloned into a glass get one, and the effect is
 * dropped again as soon as the last clone of them goes away.

 * [FIX-5] "Quick Settings turns into a full-screen dark rectangle, Toggles
 * show nothing" the moment bgActor became a child of animActor (a real
 * St.BoxLayout, used for the actual quick-settings grid).
 *
 * Root cause: unlike a plain Clutter.Actor (which — absent an explicit
 * LayoutManager — does NOT roll its children's sizes into its own reported
 * preferred size; this is exactly why bgActor's own many manually-sized
 * descendants, or bgActor itself sitting under uiGroup, never caused any
 * such ballooning before), St.BoxLayout DOES actively query each direct
 * child's own get_preferred_width()/height() and stacks/sums them to
 * compute ITS OWN size. bgActor has an EXPLICIT fixed size set on it
 * directly (set_size(screenW, screenH) — see _syncToggleRegions()/
 * resolution-update code), and an actor's own explicitly-set size is
 * exactly what get_preferred_width()/height() reports back to a querying
 * parent, regardless of any layout manager. So animActor's BoxLayout was
 * faithfully doing its job: stacking a "child" that claims to want
 * 1920x1080, on top of the real ~1920x198 toggle content — hence the
 * ballooned (1958x1316) allocation and the screen-covering dark panel.
 *
 * Fix: LayoutOpaqueActor unconditionally reports (0,0) for both min and
 * natural size in both dimensions, no matter what its own children (e.g.
 * bgActor) request. A querying parent's LayoutManager takes exactly what
 * get_preferred_width()/height() returns as authoritative — it never looks
 * past that return value into the subtree — so this is a hard, guaranteed
 * "don't count anything below me towards your own size" boundary, usable
 * to wrap any actor (like bgActor) that must be dropped into a real
 * layout-managed container (like animActor) purely for z-order, with its
 * own geometry fully hand-managed instead of participating in that
 * container's size negotiation. Its own on-screen ORIGIN (x,y) still comes
 * from wherever the parent's layout manager decides to place a 0-sized
 * child — callers reposition it explicitly every frame regardless (see
 * quickSettingsManager.ts's animActor counter-transform), so that's fine.

 *
 * Neither of the first two is right, and which one is in use decides which

 * extensions on in either order:
 *
 *   SNAPSHOT — Liquid Glass sees BMS at clone time and takes a self-excluding
 *     stage snapshot of the child's rect. BMS itself keeps working, but the
 *     snapshot is of the WHOLE stage cropped to that rect, so anything else
 *     overlapping it is captured too: with the dock moved to the top edge it
 *     overlaps the panel and its icons show up as ghosts inside the dock's own
 *     glass. The window texture lag was reported in this configuration as well.
 *
 *   CLONE — Liquid Glass was enabled first, found no BMS target, and made an
 *     ordinary Clutter.Clone. No ghosts and no lag, but BMS's own panel
 *     rendering drifts by about 10px wherever the dock overlaps the panel:
 *     Shell.BlurEffect in background mode samples the framebuffer under the
 *     actor, and painting that actor a second time inside our offscreen gives
 *     it a second, differently-positioned consumer.
 *
 *   SKIP — leave the child out of the glass entirely. No ghosts, no lag, BMS
 *     untouched; the cost is that the panel simply does not appear in the
 *     blurred backdrop.
 *
 * Switchable at runtime (global._lgGlass.bmsMode(n)) so the attribution can be
 * settled inside one session instead of by rebuilding between orders.

//                 child's rect, and it runs a full stage paint with our root
//                 hidden on every after-paint — the very "toggle live UI
//                 visibility every frame" that memo.md's addendum 3 records
//                 as breaking Clutter's damage bookkeeping)
//   1 CLONE    -> lag and ghosts gone, but BMS's own panel drifts ~10px
//                 wherever the dock overlaps it
//   2 SKIP     -> all three gone; the panel simply is not in the glass
//
// SKIP breaks nothing, but it gives up the panel: with the dock at the top
// edge the dock's glass is drawn ABOVE panelBox, so a panel that is not in the
// glass is a panel that is not on screen there at all.
//
//   3 REPLICATE -> the default. None of the three costs above.
//
// REPLICATE works because of one structural detail of BMS: it inserts its
// blur widget into panel_box as a SIBLING of the panel
// (components/panel.js — `panel_box.insert_child_at_index(background_group, 0)`),
// not as a child of it. So "the panel without BMS's blur widget" is not
// something that has to be filtered out of a clone — it is simply a different
// actor to clone. BMS is then never painted a second time, which is the whole
// of the CLONE problem, and nothing is snapshotted, which is the whole of the
// SNAPSHOT problem.
//
// What that leaves missing is the blurred backdrop BMS draws behind the panel,
// so we draw our own in its place: the same effect class BMS uses
// (Shell.BlurEffect in BACKGROUND mode — see BMS's
// effects/native_dynamic_gaussian_blur.js) with the same live radius and
// brightness, sitting under the panel clone inside our own offscreen, where
// what is "behind" it is our own cloned wallpaper and windows. Same effect,
// same parameters, same input relationship — so it reproduces what BMS draws

   *     already has a second consumer, and its own panel rendering drifts
   *     (reported: about 10px, whenever the dock overlaps the panel).
   *
   * Driven by comparing the resolved target each refresh rather than by
   * extension-state-changed: BMS populates _panel_blur.actors_list during and
   * after its own enable(), so a signal handler can easily look too early,
   * while "the target is not what it was" is true whenever it settles.

//
// Every manager keeps a self-rescheduling Meta.LaterType.BEFORE_REDRAW chain
// alive for as long as its target is mapped, and re-syncs its geometry and its
// clones on every single tick. That is a poll, not an event: the dock's glass
// was measured running vfunc_paint_target 119 times in 2.0s (= 59.5/s) with
// the desktop sitting still.
//
// This switch makes every tick reschedule itself and do nothing else. It does
// NOT stop the laters — so if the GPU load collapses, the cost is the per-frame
// sync work and the repaint it dirties into existence, and the fix is to make
// those ticks conditional. If the load barely moves, the cost is elsewhere and
// idle gating would be wasted effort.
//
// Diagnostic only: while frozen the glass stops following anything that moves.

// gjs answers this one from the JS side without touching the C object (that

//
// Trap 1: `String(actor)` does NOT reach gjs here. gnome-shell's
// environment.js:366 replaces Clutter.Actor.prototype.toString with
//     Clutter.Actor.prototype.toString = function () {
//         return St.describe_actor(this);
//     };
// St.describe_actor() is a C call, so on a disposed actor it (a) emits the
// very "impossible to access it" critical this function exists to prevent —
// with a backtrace pointing at the String() line — and (b) returns a plain
// description that never contains "(DISPOSED)". Going through
// GObject.Object.prototype.toString bypasses the override.
//
// Trap 2: reading a property off a disposed wrapper does not throw AND does
// not return undefined — gjs logs the critical and hands back the type's
// default, so `actor.visible` is `false`, a perfectly good boolean, and the
// old `typeof actor.visible === 'boolean'` test passed for dead actors.
// Method calls behave the same way (critical, no throw). That is why every
// try/catch guard in this file was a no-op and why _cleanupState() went on
// to call remove_constraint()/destroy() on disposed actors.
// Verified against gjs 1.88.0 with a standalone run_dispose() repro.
